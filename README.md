## Lauren | Founder-Scientist, Product Strategist 👩🏻‍💻

## Bridging the Gap Between Human Intuition and Machine Rigor
I am a Master’s candidate in Data Science at Boston University specializing in the intersection of Quantitative UX Research and Product Strategy. My background as a General Manager and startup leader allows me to look past the numbers to see the human behavior and business outcomes they represent.

## 🚀 Why I Traded My GM Title for a Python Terminal
In 2020, I led the team at Puraka Masks as General Manager through the height of the West Coast wildfires and the global pandemic. I spearheaded our migration to Shopify, managed global supply chains, and built a brand centered on inclusive, eco-friendly product lines.

While I successfully navigated the "Front-of-House"—securing top Google rankings and building deep customer trust—I also saw how "data black boxes" in logistics could dismantle a mission-driven business. I am now building the technical "shield" I wish I’d had then. I translate founder intuition into technical expertise to help companies turn complex datasets into actionable product strategies.
